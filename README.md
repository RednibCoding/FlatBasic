# FlatBasic
Small statically typed, compiled basic language that has about the same abstraction level as c.
Flat basic compiles to c and can interface with c.

## Bootstrap
Python is just the first iteration implementation, it is planned to write FlatBasic in FlatBasic itself, which means it will be compiled to c. Then we can rid of the python implementation.
